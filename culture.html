    <div class="culture">
        <p>I have ecountered many cultural differences between Denmark and America while living in Boise, Idaho. </p>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by different cultures. This was my first time travelling to the USA and it quickly became evident to me that the American culture differs from the Danish culture in several ways.</p>
    </div>

    <h2> Academics</h2>

    <ul id="differences">
        <li>Grading</li>
        <li>Work load</li>
     <li>Academic level</li>
    </ul>

<div class="grade">
    <p><i>Grading</i> is the first thing I noticed differ from what I am used to. At college in Denmark we do not collect credits during the semester. Finals are the only things that contribute to out final grade for each class.</p>
    <p><i>The work load</i> is a thrid thing that is different. Due to the grading system in the US there are a lot of assignments and weekly deadlines. I am not used to that in Denmark where I always just have to read for each class. Sometimes we do class presentations, but the amount of busy work here at BSU really choked me.</p>
    <p><i>The adacemic level</i> is another thing that differs from what I am used to. I can only speak for my own experience as a media studies major but the academic level at the classes I have taken are more similar to high school in Denmark. I am used to studying scientific theories in Denmark and here I am back to reading textbooks.</p>

    <h2>Sustainability</h2>
    <ul id="differences">
        <li>Driving</li>
        <li>Disposable items</li>
        <li>Shopping habbits</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="sustainability">
    <p><i>Driving</i> your car instead of other types of transportaions. In Denmark students ride their bike, walk or use public transportation to get around. It does not make sense for students in bigger cities to have cars due to the limited parking options. We also do not consider it to be worth it to take a car just to get to campus when it just takes around 10-5 minutes for most people by bike.</p>
    <p><i>Disposable items</i> are banned in Denmark to a certain extent. We do not have any disposable plastic anymore. It was a cultural chok to see everyone grabbing coffee from Starbucks everyday and even using a plastic straw just to stir their drink sometimes. It is also not legal for stores to give free plastic bags to costumers so everyone in Denmark always bring their own bags when shopping.</p>
    <p><i>Shopping habbits.</i>Everyone shops from stores like Shein and Amazon and values price over quality and sustainability.</p>
   </div>
   
    <h2>Fashion</h2>
    <ul id="differences">
        <li>Lounge wear</li>
        <li>Ignoring the weather conditions</li>
        <li>BSU merch</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="fashion">
        <p><i>Lounge wear</i> is normal to wear to school. I have observed people in their pyjamases in class and I have even seen people wear their slippers to the club which surprised me.</p>
        <p><i>Ignoring the weather conditions.</i> It has been a historically cold spring semester in Boise this year. However poeple are not dressing accordingly. Very few people wear a jacket to class. Nobody brings a coat when going downtown because there is no pllace to put it. Yhis is regardless wether it is snowing which is wild to me.</p>
        <p><i>Bouse State University Merch</i> is worn by 9/10 students on a daily basis. Our universities in Denmark do not have merch and this is such an American concept to</p>
