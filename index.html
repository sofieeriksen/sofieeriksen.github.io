    <div class="intro">
        <p>My name is Sofie Eriksen. I am 23 years old and I am from Denmark. I am currently finishing my last semster of my bachelor's degree in <i>media studies</i>. During the spring semester 2023 I have been studying abroad as an exchange student at Boise State University. This blog will take you through my journey.</p>
        <p>This blog serves as my final project in the Web Design class that I am taking. At Aarhus University I have developed strong analytizal skills but I have not been trained in any practical skills. As a media studies major I am certain that web design will only become more relevant and this is why I was happy to enroll in this course. I really wanted to learn some new skills where my progress actually can be tracked and seen visually. During this course I have become familiar with the basics of web design. I have both learned how to code HTML and CSS and I have also gotten experience with setting up a website using non-coding platforms such as Wordpress and Squarespace.</p>
        <p>I am grateful that I have been able to get new ecperiences in many different ways during my four months in the United States. I have developed new academic skills, I have met new friends and I have travelled to new placed during my stay here. Keep on reading to find out more about this.</p>

    <h1>Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness</h1>
    <h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>
    <p>By <b>Beth Skwarecki</b></p>
    
    <img src="fitness.jpg" width="70%">
    
    <p>Whenever there’s a task you don’t want to do, there’s a guaranteed way to feel worse about it: Just add a whole layer of guilt and disappointment on top. Streaks that you’ll inevitably break, badges you don’t care about, check-in notifications that bug you when you were just trying to relax. Ahh, gamification.
        <p>Before we talk about all the reasons gamification is bullshit, let’s talk about why games work the way they do. In a roleplaying game, you earn “experience points” as a metaphor for real-life experience. You earn fake money because it’s meant to mimic the concept of real-life money. You’re given a quest because, in real life, people work hard in pursuit of goals. Games have these metrics and structures because the game is trying to imitate real life</p>
        <p>Real life doesn’t require fake metrics. You don’t need to rack up XP, because you’re gaining actual experience. You don’t need a fake quest, because you’re on a real quest. Whether that’s deadlifting 500 pounds or seeing better cholesterol numbers the next time you go to the doctor, your health habits have real-world rewards and consequences.</p>

    <h4>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h4>
        
        <p>Streaks entertain you during good times with the explicit goal of heaping disappointment on you when you slip up. And they’re a particularly harmful type of misdirection, because people easily become more focused on the streak than on whatever reason they were doing the streak in the first place.</p>


        <ul>
            <li>Running a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group.</li>
            <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day.</li>
            <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.</li>
        </ul>
