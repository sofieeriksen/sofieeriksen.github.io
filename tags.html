    <p>I am taking this class to learn the basics of web design such as creating a website in different ways.</p>
    <p>HTLM is the current coding language that I am currently using at is it considered the <q>back bone</q> of the web.</p>
    <p>I like learning new things and i think coding is an <strong>excellent</strong> skill to have.</p> <!--This is marked as strong because i want to emphazise it as being important-->

    <p>At BSU I am taking <em>five</em> classes:</p> <!--i used formatting to emphazise the number five-->
    <ol>
        <li>Web design</li>
        <li>Gender in Communication</li>
        <li>Introduction to Public relations</li>
        <li>Media Literacy in the digital age</li>
        <li>The arbiter</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I <u>really hope</u> to get to try river rafting here in Boise even though I am <em>not</em> here during summer!</p>
    
    <p>I  want to go travel to some of the national parks. Maybe Yellow Stone National Park which looks <i>very</i> beautiful:</p>

    <p> Another thing i want to try is to river raft with <q>Cascade Raft and Kayak</q> and their website can be found through the link below:</p>
